# Stub File Marker

This `.stub` file tells the Tailwind hook to automatically generate editable
snippet stubs in your project's `site/snippets/blocks/` directory.

## How it works:
1. When Kirby loads (in debug mode), the hook scans for plugins with `.stub` files
2. For each `.stub` file found, it creates deactivated stub files (prefixed with `_`)
3. These stubs are copied from the plugin's snippets to your project
4. To activate a stub, simply remove the leading underscore from the filename

## Example:
- Generated stub: `site/snippets/blocks/_pwtext.php` (inactive)
- Activated override: `site/snippets/blocks/pwtext.php` (active, overrides plugin)

## Benefits:
- Edit snippets without modifying plugin code
- Stubs are pre-filled with plugin defaults
- Easy to activate/deactivate overrides
- Project-specific customizations stay in your project

Do not delete this file unless you want to disable automatic stub generation.
