# Stub File Marker

This `.stub` file tells the Tailwind hook to automatically generate modular
CSS patch stubs in your project's `site/patches/css/` directory.

## How it works:
1. When Kirby loads (in debug mode), the hook scans for plugins with `.stub` files
2. For each CSS module in this plugin, it creates a deactivated patch (prefixed with `_`)
3. These patches are copied from the plugin to `site/patches/css/kirbyblock-text/`
4. To activate a patch, simply remove the leading underscore from the filename

## Example:
- Generated patch: `site/patches/css/kirbyblock-text/_custom.css` (inactive, plugin CSS used)
- Activated patch: `site/patches/css/kirbyblock-text/custom.css` (active, overrides plugin)

## Benefits:
- Override specific CSS modules without touching plugin files
- Patches are pre-filled with plugin defaults
- Easy to activate/deactivate individual modules
- Tailwind automatically watches active patches

Do not delete this file unless you want to disable automatic patch generation.
