# KirbyUp Build Marker

This `.kirbyup` file tells the project's build system to automatically watch
and rebuild this plugin when its source files change.

## How it works:
1. The project's `kirbyup-sync.config.js` scans for plugins with `.kirbyup` files
2. For each plugin found, it runs `kirbyup src/index.js --watch` in the background
3. When you edit Vue/JS files in `src/`, the plugin is automatically rebuilt
4. Compiled output is written to `index.js` and `index.css` in the plugin root

## Build Process:
- Source: `src/index.js` (entry point)
- Output: `index.js` (compiled) + `index.css` (compiled styles)
- Runs: Automatically via `npm run dev` or `npm run watch`

## Benefits:
- No manual build commands needed
- Instant feedback when editing components
- Only rebuilds changed plugins (fast)
- Consistent build setup across all plugins

## Manual Build:
If needed, you can build manually from the project root:
```bash
cd /path/to/project
npx kirbyup site/plugins/kirbyblock-quote/src/index.js
```

Do not delete this file unless you want to disable automatic building.
